# InbreedingAndDNA
This code is a simplification of DNA. It simulates breeding, mutations, and inbreeding thanks to a family tree. It connects DNA to specific attributes and its highly scalable.

# Dog Class

The Dog class is a Python class that simulates the genetics of dogs. It allows users to create instances of the Dog class with custom DNA sequences and attributes such as coat color, eye color, coat type, and sex. The class also includes methods for generating DNA sequences, mutating DNA, reproducing offspring, and calculating inbreeding coefficients.
Features

    Create custom dogs with specific DNA sequences and attributes
    Generate random DNA sequences for coat color, eye color, coat type, and sex
    Mutate DNA sequences to simulate genetic variation
    Reproduce offspring with attributes inherited from their parents
    Calculate inbreeding coefficients based on the relationship between parents
    Print a summary of a dog's attributes and DNA sequence
